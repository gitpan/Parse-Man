NAME
    "Parse::Man" - parse nroff-formatted manpages

DESCRIPTION
    This abstract subclass of Parser::MGC recognises nroff grammar from a
    file or string value. It invokes methods when various nroff directives
    are encountered. It is intended that this class be used as a base class,
    with methods provided to handle the various directives and formatting
    options. Typically a subclass will store intermediate results in a data
    structure, building it as directed by these method invocations.

TEXT CHUNK FORMATTING METHODS
    The following methods are used to parse formatted text. Each is passed a
    plain string value from the input content.

  $parser->chunk_B( $text )
    Handles text content from ".B" directives and "\fB" inline formatting.

  $parser->chunk_I( $text )
    Handles text content from ".I" directives and "\fI" inline formatting.

  $parser->chunk_R( $text )
    Handles text content from ".R" directives and "\fR" inline formatting.

    These above three methods are also used to handle ".BI", ".IB", ".RB",
    ".BR", ".RI" and ".IR" directives.

  $parser->chunk_SM( $text )
    Handles text content from ".SM" directives.

PARAGRAPH HANDLING METHODS
    The following methods are used to form paragraphs out of formatted text
    chunks. Their return values are ignored.

  $parser->para_TH( $name, $section )
    Handles the ".TH" paragraph which gives the page title and section
    number.

  $parser->para_SH( $title )
    Handles the ".SH" paragraph, which gives a section header.

  $parser->para_SS( $title )
    Handles the ".SS" paragraph, which gives a sub-section header.

  $parser->para_TP( $opts )
    Handles a ".TP" paragraph, which gives a term definition.

  $parser->para_IP( $opts )
    Handles a ".IP" paragraph, which is indented like the definition part of
    a ".TP" paragraph.

  $parser->para_P( $opts )
    Handles the ".P", ".PP" or ".LP" paragraphs, which are all synonyms for
    a plain paragraph content.
